## Pages

- [The main page, my CV](./index.md)
- [Er-form introduction of me](./er.md)

## Random fact

Did you know that my website will be [frozen and stored at Svalbard in Norway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzI9FNjXQ0o) on February 2020, alongside with other repositories, yours included? 
Also this README seemed too short, so that's why there is this random fact.
