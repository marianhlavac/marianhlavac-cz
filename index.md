# Hey there, my&nbsp;name&nbsp;is&nbsp;Mari치n.

I'm 24-yo full-stack web developer and technology enthusiast with interests
in&nbsp;various multimedia, art and&nbsp;design.
I have experiences with both front-end and&nbsp;back-end web development, 
project design, UI/UX design and&nbsp;hardware.
I'm currently creating a&nbsp;[device to make drones smarter and safe](
https://getdronetag.com){:target="_blank"}.  
I also teach 3D Printing
at&nbsp;[Czech Technical University](http://fit.cvut.cz){:target="_blank"}.


## How to contact me

My full name is **Mari치n Hlav치캜** (Bc. Mari치n Hlav치캜, if you like titles)
and I currently live in&nbsp;游늸**Taipei,&nbsp;Taiwan** (but normally I'm based in 
Prague, Czech Republic).

You can drop me a&nbsp;line at&nbsp;&nbsp;九괦잺&nbsp;[m@marianhlavac.cz](mailto:m@marianhlavac.cz).  
I can be found on social networks --- such as
[LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/marian-hlavac){:target="_blank"}, 
[GitHub](http://github.com/mmajko){:target="_blank"}, 
[Facebook](http://fb.com/marian.hlavac){:target="_blank"} 
or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mmajko){:target="_blank"}.


## What I do

I'm a&nbsp;full-stack web developer with an emphasis on the 
**front-end technologies**, and I consider web technologies as my main focus.
Alongside that, I sometimes do UI design, develop games, or fiddle with
hardware, but if I were ever to sell myself, I reckon they wouldn't make 
a&nbsp;good selling points.

### Web Development
I try to cover all corners of the field, from setting up the server, 
writing the code or keeping the code maintainable, to
testing with users and focusing on good UI and UX.

Last months I've been working the most with the **React** framework, using it
together with **TypeScript**. Some **Python**, **Node.js** and **Rust** projects
are currently sitting on my hard drive as well.

### Development Techniques & Project Management
Regarding to good development practices, 'clean commit history', 'code review',
'continuous integration', or 'automation' --- those are some of the terms that 
I like more than I like eating a&nbsp;dessert after a&nbsp;lunch. And I really 
like having a&nbsp;dessert after a&nbsp;lunch.

I also like **open-source** and non-proprietary solutions, 
so for example, it shouldn't be surprising that this resume is 
[a&nbsp;Markdown file](https://github.com/mmajko/marianhlavac-cz/blob/master/index.md)
that can be converted easily into PDF, this website, or printed.  
Or some would say I'm just a&nbsp;big nerd.

### Hobbies & Other skills
I often spend some time on improving myself in different fields. I actually 
have more hobbies, than those listed below, but I find hobbies such as 
"playing Tetris", "cooking", or "drinking beers", highly irrelevant to the 
purpose of this page.

- **Design** --- I like designing user interfaces, print design, 
  3D modelling etc.
- **Game development** --- Both my bachelor and master thesis are dedicated to 
  exploring the possibilities of XR (Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality).
- **Hardware** --- Arduino, Raspberry Pi, robotics and embedded systems
- **Photography, Video editing**
- **Music composition & production**


## My past experiences

For almost a&nbsp;decade I dedicated myself to gaining experiences in web
technologies. I started small, creating websites for my friends and colleagues
in the old-school Xara Designer, then continued to learn how to program
small web apps in PHP and now I'm in charge of technical infrastructure of
a&nbsp;young technological start-up. Whew, time flies.

- ### Co-Founder at **Dronetag**
  - *Nov 2018 -- now*
  - We started in 2018, when we came up with this idea and won
    in the Space Application Hackathon competition and decided not to leave
    the idea right after. In Dronetag, I put myself in the role of
    technological manager, created the foundations for underlying technologies
    that powers Dronetag's web platform and continues to work on them, as well
    as work on the user interface of all client applications.

- ### Developer & Project Architect at **FIT CTU**
  - *Jan 2015 -- Aug 2019*
  - At Faculty of Information Technology I first started as a&nbsp;front-end 
    developer, but as time went on, I was working on some projects on my own, 
    helped designing user interfaces for various faculty applications, or helped
    to shape the future of faculty website or learning materials system.

- ### Frontend Developer at **Brand New**
  - *May 2013 -- Sep 2015*
  - At young marketing agency I was involved in creating web presentations
    for various clients. Most of the time I was working on the front-end code,
    HTML&CSS was my daily. Together with a&nbsp;very capable and social 
    Brand New team we delivered engaging campaigns and projects for clients
    such as Beko or Nestl칠.

- ### Freelancing
  - *2010 -- 2013*
  - When I was at high school, I discovered that I am able to make a&nbsp;few
    bucks by creating websites for smaller clients. I registered as 
    self-employed and started working as freelancer.

If you made it all the way down here, I'd like to thank you. If you read this
page as a&nbsp;CV, I acknowledge that nobody likes long CVs with a&nbsp;bunch
of long texts and stories and whatnot. But I think that one should find 
a&nbsp;five minutes to read about someone, If he wants that someone to be 
willing to spend more than five minutes on his project.
