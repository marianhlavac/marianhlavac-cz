# Hey there, my&nbsp;name&nbsp;is&nbsp;Mari√°n.

I'm 25-yo full-stack web developer and technology enthusiast with interests
in&nbsp;various multimedia, art, and&nbsp;design.
I have experience with both front-end and&nbsp;back-end web development, 
project design, UI/UX design, and&nbsp;hardware.
I'm currently working on a&nbsp;[device to make drones smarter and safe to access our airspace](
https://getdronetag.com){:target="_blank"}.  
I also teach 3D Printing
at&nbsp;[Czech Technical University in Prague](http://fit.cvut.cz){:target="_blank"}.


## How to contact me

My full name is **Mari√°n Hlav√°ƒç** and I currently live
in&nbsp;üìç **Prague,&nbsp;Czech Republic**.

You can drop me a&nbsp;line at&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úâÔ∏è&nbsp;[m@marianhlavac.cz](mailto:m@marianhlavac.cz).  
I can be found on social networks --- such as
[LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/marian-hlavac){:target="_blank"}, 
[GitHub](http://github.com/marianhlavac){:target="_blank"}, 
[Facebook](http://fb.com/marian.hlavac){:target="_blank"}, 
or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mmajko){:target="_blank"}.


## What I do

I'm a&nbsp;full-stack web developer with an emphasis on the 
**front-end technologies**, and I consider web technologies as my main focus.
Alongside that, I sometimes do UI design, develop games, or fiddle with
hardware, but those skills are not much serious.

### Development
I try to cover all corners of the field, from setting up the server, 
writing the code while keeping the code maintainable, to
testing with users, focusing on good UI and UX and overall final result
presented to users.

Last months, the majority of the code I've written was in **Python** & **Dart**,
but previously I've been working a lot with **React** framework (using 
**TypeScript**). From time to time I write a few lines in
in **Swift**, **Kotlin**, **C++**, **Rust** or other languages.

### Development Techniques & Project Management
I value good development practices. I keep clean commit history and try to guide
others to do the same. Code reviews are for sure, as well as CI/CD,
routine automation, or automated code tests.

I also like **open-source** and non-proprietary solutions, 
so for example, it shouldn't be surprising that this resume is 
[a&nbsp;Markdown file](https://github.com/marianhlavac/marianhlavac-cz/blob/master/index.md)
that can be converted easily into PDF, this website, or printed.  
Or some would say I'm just a&nbsp;big nerd. Also true.

### Hobbies & Other skills
I often spend some time improving myself in different fields. I actually 
have much more hobbies than the below listed, but I find hobbies such as 
"playing Tetris" or "cooking", highly irrelevant to the 
purpose of this page.

- **Design** --- I like designing user interfaces, print design, 
  3D modelling etc.
- **Game development** --- Both my bachelor and master thesis were dedicated to 
  exploring the possibilities of XR (Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality).
- **Hardware** --- Arduino, Raspberry Pi, robotics and other embedded systems.
- **Photography, Video editing**
- **Music composition & production**


## My past experiences

For almost a&nbsp;decade I dedicated myself to gaining experiences in web
technologies. I started small, creating websites for my friends and colleagues
in the old-school Xara Designer, then continued to learn how to program
small web apps in PHP, and now I'm in charge of the technical infrastructure of
a&nbsp;young technological start-up. Whew, time flies.

- ### Co-Founder at **Dronetag**
  - *Nov 2018 -- now*
  - We started in 2018 when we came up with this idea and won
    in the Space Application Hackathon competition and decided not to leave
    the idea right after. In Dronetag, I put myself in the role of
    technological manager, created the foundations for underlying technologies
    that power Dronetag's web platform and continues to work on them, as well
    as work on the user interface of all client applications.

- ### Developer & Project Architect at **FIT CTU**
  - *Jan 2015 -- Aug 2019*
  - At Faculty of Information Technology, I first started as a&nbsp;front-end 
    developer, but as time went on, I was working on some projects on my own, 
    helped designing user interfaces for various faculty applications, or helped
    to shape the future of faculty website or learning materials system.

- ### Frontend Developer at **Brand New**
  - *May 2013 -- Sep 2015*
  - At a young marketing agency, I was involved in creating web presentations
    for various clients. Most of the time I was working on the front-end code,
    HTML&CSS was my daily. Together with a&nbsp;competent and social 
    Brand New team, we delivered engaging campaigns and projects for clients
    such as Beko or Nestl√©.

- ### Freelancing
  - *2010 -- 2013*
  - When I was in high school, I discovered that I could make a&nbsp;few
    bucks by creating websites for smaller clients. I registered as 
    self-employed and started working as a freelancer.
